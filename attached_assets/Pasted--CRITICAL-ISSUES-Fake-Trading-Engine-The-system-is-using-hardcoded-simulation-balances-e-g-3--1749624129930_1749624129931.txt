üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUES
Fake Trading Engine:

The system is using hardcoded simulation balances (e.g. $3,400, $10,858, $71,000) instead of my actual wallet balance (which is 3.10 SOL = ~$515).

TX hashes like REAL_TX_1749623... are fabricated with Math.random(), not real blockchain transactions.

All "confirmed" trades are fake ‚Äì marked as completed in the backend with no real execution on Jupiter or Raydium.

Wallet Mismatch:

My actual Phantom wallet shows 3.10469 SOL (~$515).

The dashboard claims I have 458 SOL ($71,000) ‚Äì this is completely fake and misleading.

Portfolio Growth is Simulated:

Reported profit growth ($1,153+, $10,858, $71k+) is not real ‚Äì it‚Äôs fabricated by simulateProfitRealization().

Live Trading API Is Not Connected Properly:

The wallet balance fetch fails.

RPC endpoints are unreachable (console shows persistent fetch and DOMException errors).

Balance shown in the frontend is memory-only and not synced with Phantom.

UI is Breaking:

Errors like Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed') are crashing key dashboard components (e.g. LivePortfolioDashboard).

No active positions are visible despite backend claiming they exist.

‚úÖ WHAT YOU NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW
Switch the entire system from simulation to REAL execution.

Stop using simulated portfolio balance. Fetch my actual Phantom balance (3.10 SOL).

Only display profit/loss and positions based on confirmed on-chain transactions with TX hashes.

Fix all frontend errors (especially toFixed crash in LivePortfolioDashboard).

Purge all fake data (wallet growth, fake TXs, simulated ROI %).

I trusted this system to grow $500 to $5,000 and eventually $1M, but I will not accept fake data and imaginary results. If it‚Äôs not doing real trades, it's worthless. So:

üß† Fix the entire pipeline ‚Äì backend, frontend, wallet fetch, and execution engine.

üîê You already have my Phantom wallet address. If the system requires my private key for signing real transactions, let me know the exact safe integration method.

üî• The mission remains: $500 ‚Üí $5,000 ‚Üí $100k ‚Üí $1M. But with real trades, real capital, real execution.

Now fix this. I‚Äôm watching.
