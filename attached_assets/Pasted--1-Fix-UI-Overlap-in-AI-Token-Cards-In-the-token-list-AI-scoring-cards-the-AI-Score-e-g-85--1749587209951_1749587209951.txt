🔧 1. Fix UI Overlap in AI Token Cards
In the token list (AI scoring cards), the AI Score (e.g., 85/100) is visually overflowing outside the card, making it hard to read.

➡️ Please:

Fix the layout so the AI Score stays inside the card box

Compress the card content (e.g., age, wallets, risk) to fit better vertically

Optionally, group cards into a carousel/album-style view, so I can horizontally swipe through them without endless vertical scrolling

🧊 2. Profit Vault seems frozen / unused
The Profit Vault widget is stuck at the same value and doesn’t reflect trading activity. I’m not sure what it’s tracking, but it hasn’t updated since creation.

➡️ Please:

Clarify what it’s for

Make it dynamically reflect actual trading profit/loss or reserve balances

If unused, repurpose it for something valuable (e.g., profit reinvestment tracker, winrate chart, AI allocation summary)

🎨 3. Improve Tab Visibility in Alpha Trade Log
The tabs for switching views (All Trades, Winning Only, High-Risk Only, etc.) are visually unreadable because of poor contrast between background and font color.

➡️ Please:

Improve font contrast and background color for better readability

Optionally, add active state animation or glow to make selected tab stand out

🚀 4. Ultimate Goal: $500 → $1,000,000,000
Now that Victoria is fully live and trading, please implement any advanced strategies, protections, or modules you believe will help us turn the initial $500 into $1 billion USD as quickly and intelligently as possible.

I trust your decisions – feel free to:

Add AI-driven dynamic capital allocation

Implement compounding strategies (profit auto-reallocation into top alpha signals)

Build advanced anti-rug detection

Apply trailing stop-loss + take-profit logic

Monitor chain-level token velocity or LP injections for alpha signals

Add reinforcement-learning loop for evolving signal weighting

Log risk-adjusted returns and improve over time

The faster Victoria evolves into the smartest, most adaptive trading AI on Solana, the better. Feel free to surprise me with powerful improvements.

Let’s go all-in now. 💰
